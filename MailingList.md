# Introduction #

Salesmen developers are encouraged to share just about anything on the project's mailing-list so **don't feel shy** to post.

# Developers' List #

This list is the main communication channel for Salesmen developers.

Overview: http://groups.google.com/group/salesmen/about

In case you're more like a forum kind of person, you can totally feel yourself at home by posting and reading topics using the Web interface instead of your email client.

# Check-in Notifications #

After each commit to the SvnRepository, a detailed report of the changes is sent to this MailingList. This helps developers review code checked-in by other developers.

Please do **NOT** post to this mailing-list. Let's say you receive a notification of change in your email client. Then you should reply to that email and change the recipient address to that of the developers' list i.e. removing `-svn` from the `To` address.
