\chapter{System Build}\label{BuildSystem}

Salesmen is an application software, written in Java. The Java source code
is translated into Java byte code, which is then interpreted by the Java
virtual machine. Salesmen has a programming interface --public abstractions
that can be used by any other software agent-- that is automatically
generated by processing the annotations in Salesmen source code. \\

These are examples of mechanical processes that are executed several times 
a day during the development of Salesmen; so it's very useful to devise a 
system that abstracts common processes such as compilation, deployment, 
testing, etc. so that developers can easily invoke the execution of
common development tasks using a set of commands.\\

In this chapter, our goal is to design and implement a 
developer-friendly build system\footnote{The title of this chapter is 
``System Build'' and the system being described is called 
``Build System;'' this inverted similarity is due to the fact that the 
build system is a system to build another system, i.e. Salesmen.}
that will help automate the following processes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Deployment
\item
Testing
\item
Distribution
\end{itemize}
