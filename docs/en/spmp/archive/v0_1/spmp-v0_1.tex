		\section{Project overview}
		
			The goal of this project is to design and implement the software 
			behind an online auction website such as eBay. The codename of our project 
			is {\emph Salesmen}. 

			This project is embedded in the Software Engineering course, 
			which is designed for senior students of Computer Science and Engineering 
			at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. It has a threefold purpose:
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Get familiar with the software development process and learn to work
				in a team.
				
				\item Develop a system that supports the functionality of an auction website. 
				This means that a user will be able to sell or buy items in an online auction. 
				
				\item Develop and maintain a general website on our project. Up to date 
				versions of all documents such as minutes, timesheets and deliverables will be 
				available at any time. This site will be hosted at
				\url{http://wilma.vub.ac.be/~se2_0910/}.
			\end{enumerate}	
			
			The software of the application will be written in Java and 
			distributed under an Open Source license.

		\section{Process model}
		
		The chosen proces model will be the spiral model, with 2 iterations. Unlike
		the waterfall process, we will be able to show partial versions to the customer 
		for feedback, reducing risks such as faulty requirements.

		\begin{tabular}{l l l}
			\FL Workflow & Completion date & Deliverable to customer
			\ML \textbf{Flow 1}
			\NN Requirements & 09/11/09 & ??/11/09

			\NN Testing & 16/12/09 & 2*/12/09
			\NN
			\NN \textbf{Flow 2}
			\\ Will be defined later. \\
		\end{tabular} 	
		
		\section{Organizational structure}
		\label{sec:struc}
		
		The structure of our team will be organised as followed:
		
		\subsection{Project Manager}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Head of the project team

		\section{Organizational boundaries and interfaces}
		
		The external communication with the customer will only happen via the project
		manager, the requirements manager and the design manager. The project manager reports
		major problems, progress status and other organisatorial issues. 
		The requirements manager discusses the functionality of the system and 
		the design manager will present the design of the system to the
		customer.  
		
		\section{Project responsibilities}
		
			The responsibilities, as defined in \ref{sec:struc}, will be 
			associated to the following persons:
		
			\begin{tabular}{l l l}
				\\
				\FL Role & Effective & Assistant
				\ML Project Manager & Nick & Patrick
				\NN Project Secretary & Jonathan & Wouter
				\NN Configuration Manager & Jorne & Sina
				\NN Quality Assurance Manager & Patrick & Bart
				\NN Requirements Manager & Wouter & Jonathan
				\NN Design Manager & Bart & Nick
				\NN Implementation Manager & Sina & Jorne
				\NN Webmaster & Sina & Wouter \\
				\\
			\end{tabular}
			\\
			However, this does not mean that a person is only responsible
			for his/her own function. Every team member can be asked for assistance in all 
			processes in function to achieve the end goal.
			
			A person responsible for creating a deliverable also needs to be aware
			of the fact that
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Documents will be writen in \LaTeX-format, using the provided template.
				
				\item Documents need to be ready in time (as defined in \ref{deadlines}), and
				sent to the project manager for approval. 
				
				\item Documents needs to be up-to-date during the entire project. 
				
			\end{itemize}
			
	\chapter{Managerial process}
		
		\section{Objectives and priorities}
			
			During the development of the system, the following objectives should be kept
			in mind:
			
			\begin{enumerate}
				
				\item The project should meet the requirements of the customer
				\item Deadlines have to be respected
				\item Reusability and extensibility of the software is very important
				\item The system should be stable
				
			\end{enumerate}	
			
		\section{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item No assumptions were made.
				
				\item Dependencies \\
 					  For the project to succeed, it will depend on
					  the knowledge and the motivation of the team members	
				
				\item Constraints:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Only open-source software is to be used
					\item The product should run in a Linux environment
					\item The product should run on the Wilma server
				\end{itemize}
				
			\end{itemize}	
			
		\section{Risk Management}
			
			Developing software introduces a lot of risks. Every meeting these risks will
			be discussed in order to reduce or eliminate them. 
			
			\subsection{Google goes down for a certain period}
			\textbf{Criticality}: ++ \\
			We need to make backups of our files and documentation. This will be 
			performed by the configuration team.
			
			\subsection{Someone doesn't spend enough time on his job}
			\textbf{Criticality}: ++++ \\
			At first this will be discussed at the next meeting and a suggested action 
			will be given. Thereafter a warning will be given. Possibly there will be 
			further actions. If itâ€™s absolutely necessary, a member can be dismissed.
			
			\subsection{Deadline will not be achieved}
			\textbf{Criticality}: ++++ \\
			Not achieving a deadline, can bring the timeschedule in danger. Because of
			this a team member should report this to the project manager
			who can reorganise the tasks, as soon as he/she perceives a delay.  
			
			\subsection{Somebody becomes ill}
			\textbf{Criticality}: ++++ \\
			This risk has already been considered in the beginning of this 
			project. This is why there is an Assistant(formerly called Backup) for 
			every Management position. If a leader or manager gets ill, the assistant 
			of that function should be able to fully understand his 
			function and replace that leader or manager, for a certain period of time.
			
			\subsection{The client can't make an appointment before the deadline}
			\textbf{Criticality}: + \\
			The client should be contacted as soon as possible. \emph{Update: The client has been
			contacted on Friday, October 23, 2009 and an appointment has been made on Monday,
			October 26, 2009.}
			
			\subsection{The wrong questions have been asked to the client}
			\textbf{Criticality}: +++ \\
			There should be at least two appointments with the client before the first version of
			the SRS becomes available.
			
			\subsection{The requirements are misunderstood or misinterpreted}
			\textbf{Criticality}: +++ \\
			The interview with the client will be recorded and will be made available to all team
			members. This interview will be relistened by the Quality Assurance manager to reduce
		 	misinterpretations. In order to avoid ambiguity, there will be a presentation of the
		 	requirements during another meeting with the client.			
				
		\section{Monitoring and controlling mechanisms}	
			
			\subsection{Meetings}
			Meetings will be held every week. The topics to handle at the meeting will be defined
			in an agenda and will be sent to every team member before the start of the
			meeting. Minutes will summarize the meetings and will be available on the project 
			website within 3 days after the meeting.
			
			Should one not be able to attend the meeting, he/she is requested to inform
			the project manager within 3 hours before the start of the meeting.
			
			\subsection{Timesheets}
			A global timesheet will be available every Monday before 12H00. Team 
			members will need to submit their timesheet on Sunday before 23h59
			for approval by the team manager.
			
	\chapter{Technical Process}
	
			\section{Methods, tools and techniques}
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Google Code \\
				There has been chosen for Google Code because it has some 
				handy features:
				
				\begin{itemize}
			 		\item Revision control system: Subversion in our case, see below.
					\item Issue tracker
					\item Wiki (is sometimes handy e.g. for meeting agenda).
					\item File download server (for our software and document releases).
				\end{itemize}

				\item Subversion \\
				This is a centralized version control system chosen for the 
				following reasons:
				
				\begin{itemize}
					\item It is easy to refactor the source code structure, 
					while preserving files' history.
					\item The whole repository has a single revision that is 
					incremented after each commit.
				\end{itemize}

				\item Eclipse \\
				Eclipse is a software development environment comprising an IDE and 
				a plug-in system to extend it. It is used to develop applications in 
				Java. It was decided to work with Eclipse because 
				it has a very userfriendly interface and because of its popularity. Also it's 
				known by most of the team members.
				
				\item \LaTeX \\
				 \LaTeX{} has been chosen to document this project because it's 
				internationally known and commonly used. Also, a few members 
				were interested in learning this language.
				
			\end{itemize}	
			
			More specific tools will be discussed later.
			
			\section{Software documentation}
			
			See the SQAP.
			
			\section{Project support functions}
			
			Throughout the entire project, Joeri De Koster and Dirk Vermeir will 
			be available for any help. For Wilma related problems, Dirk Van Deun 
			can be contacted.

			\section {Work packages}
			
			All costs are expressed in man-hours. \\
			
			\begin{tabular}{l l l}
				\FL Package & Deliverable & Total estimated time
				\ML Organizational & Meetings (+/- 30) & 210 Hr
				\NN & Timesheets & 25 Hr
				\NN & SPMP & 30 Hr

			precize after every stage in the project.
			
			\section {Dependencies}
			
			At this time, it is only possible to provide 1 general dependency :
			
			\begin{itemize}
				
				\item Iteration 2 depends on the completion of iteration 1.
