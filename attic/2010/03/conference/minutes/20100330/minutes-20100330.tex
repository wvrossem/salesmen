\section{Scope}

In order to report the current state of all three \emph{Software Engineering} projects, a conference is held on March 31. In a presentation of 30 minutes several aspects of the development should be highlighted, including managment information and a demo. This meeting is used to rehearse the final presentation. 

\section{Implementation progress}

The presentation can not be too technical, and should mainly cover the progress of the implementation and the obstacles that were encountered. Also multiple concrete examples should be given to allow the listener to fully understand why the development is so slow. \\

During the rehearsal, Sina had some problems to express himself in Dutch, so extra preparation was required. 

\section{Demo}

The presentation and demo are going to be on the same laptop, so it was practised how to switch smoothly. 


\section{Management information}

The rehearsal of the management information slides was more or less fluently, only the ending should be more convincing.
