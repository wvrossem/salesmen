\section{Agenda conference 1}

The agenda of the presentation was presented and afterwards approved by everyone.

\section{Practice presentation}

Since the presentation is constructed of 5 parts, every part was practiced by the corresponding speaker(s). Feedback was given by all team members in order to improve certain things. 

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Project information:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It's important to mention responsibility of everyone
		\item Less attention to the gap related to the timesheets between Sina and the others team members 
		\item Team has to be presented in the beginning of the presentation
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Innovation and requirements:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prototypes are not clear
		\item More interaction between speakers
		\item New slides will be made in order to improve the structure of the presentation and the interaction between both speakers. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Tools and configuration:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Content is incomplete: part on JBoss and Seam missing
		\item Asking questions to each other improves interaction
		\item New slides will be made and focus more on visualization of concepts
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Quality assurance guidelines:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Slide is too empty and will be remade
		\item Be careful in word choice
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Recap
	\begin{itemize}
		\item High speed in speaking draws attention
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}


\section{Next}

Another meeting will be held to practice the presentation on December 10. New slides can be sent to the project manager until 09/12.
