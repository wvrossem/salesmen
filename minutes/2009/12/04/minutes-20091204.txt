4     Analysis statistics


The several statistics of the workings hours for every team member have been

walked through. Clearly Sina has done too much work in comparison to the

other team members. All the other team members work approximately the

same per week (around 6 hours/week).

At the first week, there was a high peak for all team members to start up

the project.  For every team member, there was a peak in the week of the

deadline of his report (SRS,SDD, SPMP,etc.).  For the other weeks, every

team member worked approximately 6 hours/week (except for Sina).

Averaged over all weeks and all members, every member works approximately

7 hours/week.
5     Prepare Conference I


The initial, incomplete slides for Conference I have been shown and the design

was discussed.  The rest of the slides need to be supplied, without design,

by the members and sent to the Project Manager by Saturday, December 5.

Nick will then put all the slides together, using the same layout throughout

the presentation.
6     SQAP


A 2nd repository will be added on the SVN, in which only the QA team will

commit code. The purpose of this repository is to clearly show which code



                                     2


is Quality Assured.  If there would not be a 2nd repository, then Quality

Assured code would have to be set as a comment in the code, which will not

be very efficient when the code should be changed. If the code is changed, it

would not be clear which code is Quality Assured and which is not. That is

why a 2nd repository will be a perfect solution.
7     Implementation


JBoss Seam will be used as a framework.  This has as advantage that the

implementation will be separate from the logic. So xHTML will be separate

from the logic. It will also use very clean code. A programmer will only have

to make logic and for example not use the Java Search Pages.



The classes of the SDD will represent the data.  There will also be a class

that will consist of auctions that can be performed on other classes.



Everyone has to install JBoss 5 and JDK 6. A Wiki page will be created that

will explain how this should be installed and how examples of JBoss Seam

can be ran.[2].



Sina will provide a list of tasks that can be done by the team by next meeting.
8     Requirements:  support several languages


This project will support different languages.  These languages will be sup-

ported, by using an extra String table, which will be used to import Strings

that have to be displayed on the website. The description of the items itself

can be translated by using Google Translate.  It's important to understand

that the first version of Salesmen will only be in English, but it will be

possible to add a new language, just using a different String table.
