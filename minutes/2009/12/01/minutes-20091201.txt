2     Logo and template



2.1    Logo


A few variants to the Bart's original Salesmen logo have been proposed.

However the original logo (with the orange S) has been elected as the logo

for Salesmen.
2.2    template


The LATEX template is will finished by Friday, December 4.
3     To do list


The to do list of the previous week has been discussed.  The report of the

presentation about Quality Assurance still needs to be made.  Jorne's and

Wouter's report about the differences in the SCMP and SRS are completed.
4     MySQL vs.  PostgreSQL


Instead of MySQL, Salesmen is going to use PostgreSQL as database. Post-

greSQL has been chosen because it has more features than MySQL and be-

cause it's generally more complete. It has features like for instance Foreign

Key(this is a key in a certain table that links to another table), which can be

very handy in this project. Normally, no SQL-statements should be written,

because EJB3 will generate this code. Much more information about a com-

parison between MySQL and PostgreSQL has been discussed by mail under

the topic MySQL vs PostgreSQL [1].
5     SDD


The SDD has greatly improved, but there are still a few details that will need

to be adapted (e.g. how transactions will be made, additional methods will

need to be included). In other words, the current SDD is not yet complete.

When the requirements will be more specified, the SDD will change accord-

ingly.  At this moment, the use cases of the SRS are included at the SDD.

This means that whenever the requirements in the SRS will change, the SDD

will have to be updated as well.  This is not really a problem, as the SDD

will then have to be checked for possible changes anyway.
                                     2


The design has to be as complete as possible: it has to include most Must

have and Want to have requirements.  The Implementation will start with

a few Must have requirements and then proceed with the Want to have's.

This does not mean that the SDD should not yet include these Want to have

requirements.


6     Implementation


Next week, the team will start will the implementation of Salesmen.  This

will be possible because the conventions will be discussed in this meeting and

will be decided by Friday. The design doesn't have to fully completed to start

the implementation. A few things can already be done. The Implementation

Manager (Sina) will give the team members implementation jobs soon.(e.g.

Issues must be created for every requirement)

Users need to be implemented as beans. This means they consist of getters

and setters. This is not yet the case in the current version of the SDD. This is

one of the reason why the Implementation Manager and the Design Manager

will need to discuss the SDD thoroughly to make an efficient implementation

of the code possible. For instance, beans can be generated by Eclipse, if the

SDD defines them correctly.
7     Competitor Analysis


There has been chosen to use Dropbox for internal documents, which will

not be published on the website. All members of the team will create their

own Dropbox account and a Dropbox folder will then be shared. The Imple-

mentation Manager (Jorne) will take care of the management of Dropbox.
8     Preparation of Conference I


There are several subjects that will be discussed on the conference. A short

description about the subjects will be given below:


 General description

      A general description of the Salesmen project and the team will be

      given, the statistics and the cost of the project will be shown.  Also,

      the planning, deadlines and what's been done so far shall be discussed.


                                     3


 Innovation and requirements

      It will be explained how Salesmen will make the life of buyers, sellers

      and the owner of the site easier.  Requirements meant especially for

      this job will be explained.  The fact that there is a possibility to add

      tags to an auction and that objects can be recommended using tags

      from existing auctions. Also, the possibilities Salesmen creates for the

      owner to earn money will be thoroughly presented.


 Configuration and tools

      Following items will be clarified:  the timesheets of Salesmen, Google

      Code (and it's possibility for SVN ),the possibility to browse the SVN

      through a web browser and finally code reviews.


 Quality Assurance

      Especially the differences with the other groups will be shown.  Pos-

      sibly a few key words that are important in the Quality Assurance of

      Salesmen.


 Pitch

      A summary of the strengths of Salesmen, showing why Salesmen is the

      right choice.
9     Risk Analysis


A list of the current risks will be kept in the SPMP. These are the new risks

discussed at the last meeting:
   1. A lack of knowledge about the tools

      Solution:

      Knowledge about Java:  It seems that the team members are still in

      touch with the syntax and implementation of Java code, so a presen-

      tation or Wiki page will not be necessary.

      Knowledge about Eclipse: A short tutorial on how to use Eclipse will

      be given on a Wiki page of the Google Code website.

      Knowledge about other tools:  Wiki pages will be supplied (e.g.  the

      SalesmenLiterature Wiki page)


   2. Examinations: The team will have to learn for the examinations.

      Solution:

      There will be a code freeze on Thursday, December 30, 2009.

                                     4


10      Highlights of November


A document concerning the Highlights of November is available on the web-

site.  This can still be reviewed (or adapted) by the team members untill

tomorrow Wednesday, December 2 and will then be e-mailed to the client.
11      SCRUM


A template for the SCRUM is available on the SVN. The template consists

of 3 parts:


   1. What a team member has been doing for the last 2 weeks.


   2. What a team member will do for the coming 2 weeks.


   3. Which problems a team member will possible encounter.


Every 2 weeks, the SCRUMs will be discussed in the meeting.
12      SRS


A few requirements have been posted on the Wiki page and will thus be

discussed and afterwards added to the SRS.
12.1     New requirements


    o Transaction costs (Must have)

      A certain percentage of every transaction will go to the owner of Sales-

      men.


    o Changing transaction costs (Nice to have)

      There should be an ability for the client to set the transaction costs to

      his preference.


    o Space for Advertising (Must have)

      Every page of the Salesmen website has to include space for advertising

      (e.g. Google Adds).


    o Platinum members

      Users can upgrade their free account to a Platinum account for a certain

      price.  This special membership will hide the ads on the website and

      can possibly imply a reduction on the costs for placing an item on the



                                     5


      Salesmen website. There has been an idea to add a Trust Symbol for

      Platinum users. It's not clear whether or not this Trust Symbol will be

      used on the Salesmen website.  Only the items of Platinum members

      can be selected for the Hot deals on the front page of the Salesmen

      website.


    o Clean URL's

      Salesmen will be using clean URL's (e.g. "http://www.salesmen.com/auction*
 */1523-

      VW-Golf3-1996" instead of "http://www.salesmen.com/auctiondetail.jsp?acti*
 *on-

      id=1523"), so the URL's become readable and the addresses have a

      clean impression.


    o Hot deals

      Specials items from Platinum members, which have a high page view

      ranking, will be displayed on the front page of the Salesmen website.

      Administrators should be able manage these hot deals.



The SRS will be updated before Sunday, December 6 at 23H00.
13      Conventions


A few examples of conventions have been proposed.  (e.g.  Will we use var-

name, Varname, varName or var_name in the code).  The team members

declared their opinion about the different choices.  The coding conventions

will be put on a Wiki page by Tuesday, December 8.
