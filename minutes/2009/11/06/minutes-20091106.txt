2     Deadlines


The SRS deadline will be changed:  the first draft needs to be available at

Monday, November 9. The deadline of the final version (of the first program-

ming cycle) will be set at Friday, November 13.



The other deadlines will be changed accordingly. The design has to be fin-

ished Friday, November 27 and the implementation plan needs to be online

at Friday, December 4, 2009.  At the end of the first program cycle, there

will be a testing phase, which will have to be finished on January 8, 2010.

All these changes will be summarized in the next version of the SPMP.


3     Requirements



3.1    Reliability


Errors in the code will be divided into 2 groups: small errors and fundamental

errors.

Fundamental errors will be corrected within 48 hours after the detection of

this error.  Small errors (details) will be corrected within a week after the

detection of these errors.
3.2    Issues


For every requirement an issue will be made on the Google Groups website[1].

In this manner, the progress of this specific requirement can be followed.

There will also be made issues for errors that have been detected. These issues

will be created by the one that discovered the error.  The Implementation

Manager will decide who needs to fix this error (mostly, but not necessarily,

the author of this code).
3.3    Layout


The layout of Chapter 3 of the current version of the SRS will be changed.

In the next version, there will be a clear distinction between the different

requirements. The requirements will be numbered with a code, corresponding

to their type.

3.4    Want to have


A new requirement that will be added to "Want to have" requirements is:

Cookies. These cookies will allow users to save their data during session.
4    ALTE X template


There is a need for a new Salesmen logo, with less colors to obtain a more

professional look.  Also, another implementation of the revision history in

the LATEX documents can be useful.
5     SCMP


The SCMP has been thoroughly discussed and explained to the team mem-

bers. It will be finished (and reviewed) by Monday, November 9, as planned.

It is important that the team members understand and learn how to use

the SCMP. This is applicable to all documents in general written about this

project. The purpose of these documents is that team members use them for

a better understanding of the project.
