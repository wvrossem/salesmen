1.2    Revision History

   1.0   ||November 25, 2009 ||First draft created

   1.1   ||November 26, 2009 ||Revised by QA Manager

2     Tools


Sina explained the different tools and terms which will be used in this project

in a short presentation. Terms like "Multitiered application", "Servlet", "Ap-

plication server","JVM", "API", Web Container","EJB" and so on, where

explained. A comprehensive list of the terms and tools can be found at the

Wiki page SalesmenLiterature [1].
2.1    Editor


Most team members have already had experience with using Eclipse, for code

editing. This is the main reason why Eclipse will be used as the Code editor

of this project.
2.2    Application server


The choice of the application server has been thoroughly discussed by the

team.  Tomcat, Glassfish and JBoss where a few of the candidates, each

with there own advantages.  Some applications are more compatible with

certain editors, than others. JBoss is very known and very stable. It provides

an official plugin for Eclipse, which was the most important argument for

choosing JBoss. As an extra, JBoss supports a hibernate function.
2.3    Database


MySQL has been chosen for the Salesmen's database because it's free (open),

good, stable, fast and commonly used.  Also, a few members already have

experience with MySQL.

2.4    Programming Language


Java EE will be used for the programming language of this project.  Scale

and Groovy are two other options, there has been decided that this project

will program in the the standard way.
2.5    Google Web Toolkit


Google Web Toolkit (GWT) translates Java to HTML and can be very handy

for this project.  There has been a lot of discussing and explaining about

GWT and whether or not to use it. The bottom line is, that nobody really

knows the functions of GWT very well.  This is why this choice has been

delayed till the next meeting.  Javascript gets information asynchronously

from a server. At the moment it is not clear if GWT support search engine

optimisation, using Ajax. Actual content of the website has to be returned

by the server, not by Javascript.
3     Logo and template



3.1    Logo


A few logo's have been proposed. Bart's logo [2] will be chosen if it will have

nicer colors and if it would be two separate logo's: one containing only the

word "Salesmen" and one containing only the short logo (with the letter S).
3.2    template


The template is almost finished. There will be made a new front page with

a more professional look, including the logo of Salesmen and the logo of the

VUB.
4     Design



4.1    Web Design


There is a prototype available of this design on the SVN Server. [3]
4.2    Implementation Design


A fairly complete class diagram for Salesmen has been shown and shortly

discussed. There were no important changes necessary at the moment. The



                                     3


SDD will be put online by Monday, November 30.
5     Brainstorm about Conference I


Following topics might be discussed at the conference:


    o Website prototypes


    o Logo


    o Statistics about planning, cost and working hours


    o Innovative ideas

      This will be a very important topic for the client. This will show how

      Salesmen is different from the other projects, so there will be a lot of

      time spent on this topic.

      e.g.  Several ways to earn money with this project.  e.g.  The search

      assistant of Salesmen.


    o The look and feel of the website


    o Choices made in this project (tools etc.)


    o Summary of the plans


    o SRS: general description of a few interesting requirements


    o Configuration Management and SVN


    o Optimization

      This is an interesting topic, but it might be that important for the

      client, so it will be omitted at the conference.


This is only a short description of what will be presented at the conference.

In the next meeting, all topics will be thoroughly discussed. Moreover, there

is a good possibility that there will be duo-presentations or dialogs to make

the presentation a bit more special.
6     Blog


There is a possibility to start a blog about the Salesmen project, in which

changes can be publiced. This blog can act as a notebook of the experiences

of the team members.. It is possible to use Ohloh for this blog, but the choice

of making a blog is not yet definitive.



                                     4


7     SPMP


A Risk table has been added and the current cost of the project has been

calculated.  At the moment the team members did work 283 hours on the

project, which means it equals about e4.245 (at e15/hour). The total hours

of the team members will be put in statistics. Also, there has been decided

to use Ohloh to clear up
8     SRS


There will be made a new Wiki page to post new requirements.  If these

requirements have been discussed and approved in the upcoming meeting,

they will be added to the SRS and deleted from this Wiki page.  This will

make it more clear for the team which requirements will be added.
8.1    Adaptations


    o Earning money

      There will have to be more requirements that clear up how the client

      can earn money with the site. Requirements such as advertising, Google

      AdWords, etc. will be added to the new version of the SRS.


    o Unactivated Users

      A new type of user will be added: unactivated users. These are users

      who have just registered on Salesmen, but who did not activate their

      account yet.


    o Costs There has to be requirements that specifies all the costs for plac-

      ing an object and for selling an object (e.g. 5% of the selling price)



Moreover, the SRS has been compared to that of the other groups. For a full

list, one can look at the difference report of the SRS which will be available

on the project website soon.
9     SCMP


The SCMP of Salesmen has also been compared to that of the other groups.

There were a few difference such as:


    o Another layout

                                     5


    o Configuration items


    o Locking files

      The possibility to lock a certain file, to be able to work on it, without

      anyone changing it.


    o Control of changes

      In the other groups there is a difference between small and little change*
 *s.

      Eeach change has it's own consequences and needs to be approved by

      the Implementation Manager. This will not be used in our project.


    o Weekly backups instead of daily backups


    o Status report of the repository (History)

      There is a good possibility that this change will be used in our project

      in the future.


In general, the SCMP of Salesmen is more complete than that of the other

groups.  For a full list, one can have a look at the difference report of the

SCMP which will be available on the project website soon.
10      SQAP


There are tools available in Eclipse to ease the use of coding conventions.

The Quality Assurance Manager will propose some coding conventions at

the meeting on Tuesday, December 1.
