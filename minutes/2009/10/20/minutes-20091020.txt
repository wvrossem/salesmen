1     Job Assignments


There has been decided that "Backup" is not an appropriate term for the as-

sistant of every function in this project. Also there is a new function "Project

Secretary". The Secretary will e.g. write the reports of the meetings. These

are the definitive roles that we have assigned on the meeting on Tuesday,

October 20, 2009 :

   _____________________________________________________
    Role                          Effective  Assistant

2     Website



2.1    Lay-out


    o Grouping of items

      As an extra feature, documents on the website will be grouped per

      meeting. At the moment there are only the different revisions available,

      as one big list. This feature will improve usability and readabilty.


    o Tutorial

      A tutorial on writing/editing/updating documents and integrating these

      documents on the server, will be written by the Configuration Manage-

      ment Team.
2.2    Issue Management


From now on, issues will be posted on the website.  These issues require

solutions to achieve a milestone.  In these issues, comments can be given

by all the team members. In this way, we can achieve our milestones in an

efficient manner.
2.3    Responsibilities


A Wiki page will be made, to clear up the responsibilities of everyone. This

page shall be managed by the Project Leader.  He will clearly specify the

tasks of every member.  These specifications will be revised by the team

members themselves.
3     Agreements



3.1    Deadlines


A few deadlines have been set:



    o Timesheets

      Everyone has to update his .XML code every Sunday before 20H00.


    o SPMP

      The first version of the SPMP (Software Project Manager Plan) will

      be made by Monday, October 26, 2009 at 20H00.



                                     2


    o SRS Questions

      A Wiki page will be made to post possible questions to ask our client.

      Update: This Wiki page has already been created on Wednesday, Octo-

      ber 21,2009 by Wouter[?]. The first version of the SRS will be finished

      by Wednesday, October 28,2009.
3.2    Timesheets


The timesheet shall be filled out be every member in .XML coding. A tem-

plate based .XML coding has been chosen to realise a straightforward solu-

tion. There's no need for an extra program or function on our website. The

Project Leader will put all the .XML codes together every Sunday. This com-

plete .XML document, can be easily converted to the appropriate necessary

file types. For extra information, one could look at [?].
3.3    Language


The language used in the code (and comments) will be English for the inter-

nationality of the code. To be consistent in every aspect, all documents will

be written in English.
4     SPMP


The spiral model with a few cycles will be used for this project, because it

has a high amount of risk analysis, combined with the advantage that the

software will be produced in an early stage of the project life cycle. This will

improve the motivation of the team members.  Both waterfall method and

extreme programming have been considered als alternatives, but they were

discarded in favor of the spiral method.
5     Tools


    o Google Code

      There has been chosen for Google Code because it has some handy

      features:


        1. Revision control system (Subversion, for extra information, see

           below).

        2. Issue tracker

                                     3


        3. Wiki (is sometimes handy e.g. for meeting agenda).

        4. File download server (for our software and document releases).


    o Subversion

      This is a centralized version control system chosen for the following

      reasons:


         - It is easy to refactor the source code structure, while preserving

           files' history.

         - The whole repository has a single revision that is incremented

           after each commit.


    o Eclipse

      Eclipse is a software development environment comprising an IDE and

      a plug-in system to extend it.  It is used to develop applications in

      Java.  [?] There has been decided to work with Eclipse because it's

      very userfriendly interface and it's popularity. Also it's know by most

      of the team members.


    o LATEX

      LATEX has been chosen to document this project because it's interna-

      tionally known and commonly used. Also, a few members were inter-

      ested in learning this language. Wouter, Sina and Jonathan have taken

      a course on Tuesday, October 20,2009 to study LATEX, to be able to

      write their reports.
6     Risk Analysis


New risks will be discussed at every meeting. A list of the current risks will

be kept on the Wiki page.

Current Risks:


   1. What if Google goes down for a certain period?

      Solution:

      Backups of our files and documentation will be performed by Jorne and

      possibly assisted by Sina.


   2. What if somebody becomes ill?

      Solution:

      This risk has already been considered in the beginning of this project.

      This is why there is an Assistant(formerly called Backup) for every
                                     4


      Management position.  If a leader or manager gets ill, the assistant

      of that function should be able to fully understand his function and

      replace that leader or manager, for a certain period of time.


   3. What if somebody doesn't spend enough time on his job?

      Solution:

      At first this will be discussed at the next meeting and a suggested

      action will be given. Thereafter a warning will be given. Possibly there

      will be further actions.  If it's absolutely necessary, a member can be

      dismissed. In this case, the solution to the risk stated above applies.
