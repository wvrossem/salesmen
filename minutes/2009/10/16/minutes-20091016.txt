5.1    SilkPage


SilkPage is an XML-based publishing tool that generates Web standards

compliant websites. We chose this tool to maintain our project's website for

the following reasons:


    o Separation of concerns: We can focus on the website's content and use

      semantic tags provided by the DocBook XML vocabulary; everything

      else is taken care of by SilkPage.


    o Native support for publishing external documents in various formats.

      [1] [2]


    o Customization layers:  SilkPage can easily be extended at CSS and

      XSLT levels. [3]
