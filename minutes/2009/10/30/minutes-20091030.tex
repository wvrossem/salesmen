	\section{Website}
	
	\subsection{\LaTeX{} template}
		This template is already in it's last stage and will be available on the website on Saturday October 31, 2009 at 14H00.
	\subsection{General}
The website is almost finished and will now get a lower priority than the development of the project itself.
	\section{SPMP}
The current version of the SPMP is reasonably good: there were only a few minor changes necessary. Chapter 5 of the SPMP is not finished yet, but this is normal at this state of the project.
	\subsection{Features}
A risk table will be made for the SPMP by Monday. Also, a Grantt Chart, including the different subproblems, will be made.
	\subsection{Agreements and Deadlines}
The deadlines written in the SPMP should be taken into account. The Minutes of Friday, October 23, was not published on time on the website. However, it was available on the SVN Server on Saturday, October 24 but  still needed a review of the Quality Assurance team. As the Quality Assurance Manager was not available that weekend and the Assistant was not informed in time, that deadline has been broken. ****** In the future, the Assistant needs to be contacted sooner, either by the Manager or by another team member if the Manager does not respond in a reasonable time.\\
As an extra attempt to obtain the deadlines, they will be published on the website as road maps or milestones.
	\section{SCMP}
The final version of the SCMP will be available on the website on Monday, November 2, 2009 as defined in the SPMP.
	\section{Requirements}

	\subsection{Agenda}
	A complete list of Agenda items is available on \cite{site4}.
