_Rev._||_Date_____________||_Description___________________________

   1.3   ||1 November, 2009 ||Ready to be uploaded
2     Website



2.1    LATEX template


This template is already in it's last stage and will be available on the website

on Saturday October 31, 2009.
2.2    General


The website is almost finished and will now get a lower priority than the

development of the project itself.
3     SPMP


The current version of the SPMP is reasonably good: there were only a few

minor changes necessary.  Chapter 5 of the SPMP is not finished yet, but

this is normal at this state of the project.
3.1    Features


A risk table will be made for the SPMP by Monday. Also, a Grantt Chart,

including the different subproblems, will be made.
3.2    Agreements and Deadlines


The deadlines written in the SPMP should be taken into account.  The

"Minutes" of Friday, October 23, was not published on time on the website

due to a delay of the Quality Assurance Team.  However, it was available

on the SVN Server on Saturday, October 24 [1].  As an extra attempt to

obtain the deadlines, they will be published on the website as road maps or

milestones. Also, the Assistant of a certain team will be contacted sooner if

the Manager does not respond in a reasonable time.

                                     2


4     SCMP


The final version of the SCMP will be available on the website on Monday,

November 2, 2009 as defined in the SPMP.
5     Quality Assurance


The role of the Quality Assurance Manager in this project was not clear

enough.  It seemed like the Quality Manager had more work than strictly

necessary. This is why this role has been thoroughly discussed in this meet-

ing. There has been decided that it is important to be consistent all over the

project and that the role of the Quality Assurance Manager has to be taken

seriously. He will also look for consistency in the code (for example: ambigu-

ous names of variables should be avoided). This is a public project, so names

of variables should be chosen carefully. However unnecessary changes in the

code are not important. One should always consider the time spent on opti-

mizing the code versus unnecessary renaming variables without adding extra

functionality or readability.  For checking the code, the Quality Assurance

Team will create specific tests to improve the code.
6     Requirements


The only requirement the client has specified was that he wanted to earn

a lot of money with this auction site.  How this site should be made can

be specified by the team. Which features will be added, will be decided by

the team. Thereafter, they will be presented to the client for approval. The

more features and functionality, the better. The requirements will be divided

into 3 classes:  "Must have", "Want to have" and "Nice to have".  This is

only a basic, incomplete and non-binding description of the Requirements, as

discussed in the meeting on Friday, October 30, 2009. For a full description of

the requirements, one should look at the SRS of this project or for a pre-final

version at the Wiki page the Requirements[2].
6.1    Must have


These features will certainly be included in the project.


    o Database of the clients


    o Possibility to identification (login)
                                     3


    o Items on the website


    o Categories


    o Search function


    o Different languages (at least 2 languages)


    o English action
6.2    Want to have


There is a good probability that these features will be included.


    o Advanced search possibilities


    o Different currencies supported


    o Ratings


    o Silent auction, Dutch auction, Fixed price
6.3    Nice to have


Under the condition that there is still time left, following features might be

included in the project.


    o Concurrency converter
