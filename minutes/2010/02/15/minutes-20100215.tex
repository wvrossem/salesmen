\section{Where do we stand?}
	This is where each member stands:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Nick] understands the basics. He feels that he understands most of the part that is important to him, authentication
		\item[Sina] feels he has a good knowledge about the framework
		\item[Jorne] is still learning the framework and trying out the examples
		\item[Wouter] also understands the basics and the parts about retrieval
		\item[Bart] has a good knowledge about Seam, but hasn't done anything yet for his part
	\end{description}

\section{What went wrong?}
	These are some of the problems that the team encountered:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It was unclear how we had to start and what we needed to do exactly
		\item There was a lack of knowledge of the framework
		\item The framework has a high entry level
		\item The time period for the implementation phase wasn't optimal because of exams
		\item Some problems to get a working environment
	\end{itemize}

\section{Solutions}
	In order to be certain that everyone has a working environment and to get everyone started, a workshop will be organized wednesday at 9 am. Every two weeks there will be a workshop, where the members can work together on the project.
	
	Sina will also put deadlines on the task, in order to get faster results and reduce our backlog.
