#summary Guide to remote deployment

= Set-up =

Open a terminal and execute this command:
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
Some questions will be asked. Just press enter each time to skip them.

Note the location where the file is created. This should be something like /home/wouter/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now we will copy this file to the wilma server using scp:
  scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub se2_0910@wilma.vub.ac.be:

Log in to wilma with the se2_0910 account.

Then we add the key to the authorized keys:
  cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys2

You cna now test if this worked by trying to log in to wilma again. You should now log in without entering a password.

  cd ./salesmen/trunk/salesmen/core
