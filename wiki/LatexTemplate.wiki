#summary Brief explanation about the latex template softproj.cls

= Introduction =

This wiki page is dedicated to explain and document the LaTeX template softproj.cls. It will also contain a section where you can request future changes/additions.


= Details =

== Declaring the class ==
You declare the documentclass as follows.

{{{
\documentclass[optfilename, twosides, otheroptions]{softproj}
}}}

== Using the Class ==
Within the document environment you must declare a new softproj environment.
Example:
{{{
\begin{document}
\begin{softproj}
Your text here
\end{softproj}
\end{document}
}}}

== .opt file ==
When declaring the documentclass, you must add the name of a .opt file which resides in the same folder as the .tex file.

The .opt file currently has following settings:
 * _\setprojectname{name}_ : Sets the name of the project.
 * _\setdocumentname{name}_ : Sets the name of the document.
 * _\setmember{memberlist}_ : Sets the list of projectmembers. (Currently has no visual effect)
 * _\setrevisioncurr{date: explanation}_ : Sets the most recent revision with Date and explanation. Watch out for using \today. Compiling on a new day results in loss of the old date.
 * _\setlogoname{name}_ : Sets the name of the logo. This should be a .jpg/.png/.gif file, but you must omit the extension. This is an optional command.
 * _\setauthorname{name}_ : Sets the name of the author on the title page.

== Additional Packages ==
There are currently no additional packages included. You must still declare the use of additional packages in your tex file.

== Titlepage? ==
You must not make a titlepage within this file. This will be created depending on your .opt file settings.

== Future Revisions ==
 * Addition of a full Version History via the .opt file. (Patrick Provinciael)
 * Additional possibilities, depending on the documentname. (Patrick Provinciael)
 * Declaration of several often used packages. (Patrick Provinciael)
