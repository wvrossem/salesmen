#labels Dev,AppServer

  # Make sure you have *JDK 6* and *Apache Ant* are installed on your machine.
  # [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss/JBoss-5.1.0.GA/ Download JBoss AS 5]. For instance, pick the pre-compiled `jboss-5.1.0.GA-jdk6.zip` as we work with JDK 6.
  # [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jboss/files/JBoss%20Seam/2.2.0.GA Download JBoss Seam 2.2].
  # Create a directory where to install JBoss AS and JBoss Seam.
    * `/opt/salesmen/` for GNU/Linux, or
    * `C:\Salesmen` for windows.
  # Unpack the downloaded archives in the newly created directory.
  # Rename unpacked directories or create symbolic links for hiding package versions.
    * For instance, `ln -s jboss-5.X.X.GA jboss` for JBoss AS, and
    * `ln -s jboss-seam-2.X.X.GA jboss-seam`
  # Set the `$JBOSS_HOME` environment variable:
    * `export JBOSS_HOME=/opt/salesmen/jboss` in GNU/Linux, and
    * In Windows, go to `Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables` to create a new environment variable called `JBOSS_HOME` with e.g. `C:\Salesmen\jboss` as value.
  # Run an instance of the JBoss AS:
    * `cd $JBOSS_HOME/bin` and `./run.sh` in GNU/Linux, and
    * `cd %JBOSS_HOME%\bin` and `run.bat` in Windows.
  # Wait until JBoss is up and running. Check here: [http://localhost:8888/]
  # Go to the directory where JBoss Seam is installed.
  # Then go to `examples/booking` or any other example.
  # Run `ant deploy`
  # Wait until JBoss deploys the application.
  # See the result in [http://localhost:8888/seam-booking/]
