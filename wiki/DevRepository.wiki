#summary Short introduction to SVN commands
#labels Configuration

= Introduction =

In this page, you'll be shown how to interact with the Subversion server to make changes to the source code.

= Get a Working Copy =

The _checkout_ command is used to pull an SVN tree such as `https://salesmen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/` from the server.

The command line for a checkout should look like this:

$ svn co https://salesmen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ salesmen --username uname@gmail.com

Please note that the above command will checkout the main development branch. Alternate development branches, meeting minutes, timesheets, etc. are not included.

= Commit Your Changes =

The _commit_ command sends your changes to the SVN server. It will commit changed files, added files, and deleted files. Note that you can commit a change to an individual file or changes to files in a specific directory by adding the path to that file/directory to the end of your command. The `-m` option should always be used to pass a log message to the command.

The command following command will commit your changes to the specified file or directory.

`$ svn ci -m "brief explanation of what you have changed" path/to/file/or/directory`

= Update your Local Working Copy =

The following command is your friend. Use it all the time so as to make sure that your working copy is synchronized with the server at all times.

`$ svn up`
