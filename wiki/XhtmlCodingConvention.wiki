= Introduction =

These are the coding conventions for xhtml programming in the Salesmen Project. Please follow these conventions. When you do not follow these conventions, add the reason why in comments with the code.

== Usage ==
First and Second denote the first and second word in a multiword variable.
All other words (or letters) must be used as shown in that particular convention.

== Usage Conventions ==

=== Indentation ===
Every level of indentation must be expressed by one single tab. Every closure starts a deeper indentation.

Exceptions can be made when multiple parameters are set. In that case, an indentation should be added until the new line starts at the same place as the first assignment. In cases of an assignment using "=", one should indent the new line in such a way the "=" signs are aligned.

Important Remark: <ui:define> must always be on the base level. This means that everything within this closure is indented with regards to the base level.

=== Comments ===
Add comments to clarify when needed. Also use comments to make distinctions between sections within a file.
