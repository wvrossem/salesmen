Auctioning web application using the Seam Framework for JBoss AS

Imported from the original repository at https://code.google.com/p/salesmen/

*We're a group of seven students who are assigned to design and implement the software behind an online auction website such as eBay. We codenamed our project Salesmen.*

*This project is embedded in the Software Engineering course, which is designed for senior students of Computer Science and Engineering at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel so as to familiarize them with the software development process and give them the opportunity to play in a team.*

*Our application will be written in the Java programming language and we'll use Enterprise Edition of the Java platform to deploy and run our code.*

*We'll release all of our deliverables including the source code under a free license.*
