\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{Requirements Control Plan}
	This section describes how the different requirements will be described and how 
	modifications to these requirements will be handled.
	Each requirement will have a unique identifier which will be used for referencing 
	in the source code, the design, ... Some requirements will only be described by
	a short description, while others will be described by a use case.
	Whenever a requirement changes, the change will be noted at the description of 
	the requirement. If a requirement is retired, this will also be noted at the
	requirement description, together with a reason why the requirement is retired.
