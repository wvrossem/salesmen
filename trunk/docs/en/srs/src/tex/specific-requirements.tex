\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{Requirements Control Plan}

	This section describes how the different requirements will be defined and how 
	modifications to these requirements will be handled.
	
	Each requirement will have a unique identifier which will be used for referencing 
	in the source code, the design, ... Some requirements will only be described by
	a short description, while others will be described by a use case.
	
	Whenever a requirement changes, the change will be noted at the description of 
	the requirement. If a requirement is retired, this will also be noted at the
	requirement description, together with a reason why the requirement was retired.

\section{Database Requirements}
	All data will be saved in the database. The database must always remain consistent. There will be many concurrent request 
	for the database. A good database structure will be needed. 
\section{Design Constraints}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The design must be object-oriented
		\item Design diagrams must be made using UML
	\end{enumerate}
\section{Software system attributes}
	\subsection{Reliability}
		Errors in the code will be divided into 2 groups: \textit{small errors} and \textit{fundamental errors}. \\ 
		Fundamental errors will be corrected within 48 hours after the detection of this error. Small errors (details) will be corrected within a week after the detection of these errors. 
%	\subsection{Availability}
	\subsection{Security}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item When a user want to recover his or her password, the site will generate a new password and send it to the user's e-mail.
			\item Communication of sensitive data should be encrypted (e.g. using https)
			\item Users should only be allowed to try to log in a limited number of times
			\item When a guests registers for an account, he or she has to fill in a CAPTCHA
