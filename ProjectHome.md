We're a group of seven students who are assigned to _design_ and _implement_ the software behind an online **auction website** such as eBay. We codenamed our project **Salesmen**.

This project is embedded in the _Software Engineering_ course, which is designed for senior students of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](http://www.vub.ac.be/) so as to familiarize them with the software development process and give them the opportunity to play in a team.

Our application will be written in the Java programming language and we'll use Enterprise Edition of the Java platform to deploy and run our code.

We'll release all of our deliverables including the source code under a free license.
